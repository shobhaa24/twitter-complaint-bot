# twitter-complaint-bot

This is a webscraping project.
Its an Internet speed twitter complaint bot.

This program uses "SELENIUM" package to scarpe through the data.

We first scrape through the website "https://www.speedtest.net/" and get the values of our download mbps and upload mbps. If the values are lesser than what was promised to us, we raise a complaint by tweeting from our twitter account.

This is a Fun Project and the whole process of raising a complaint is taken care by the code.
